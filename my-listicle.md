## Websites I made in middle school

 1. I made [The Jaystore](https://thejaystore.wordpress.com/) as a way to kill time in class and help out my classmates. Make an account to start earning **Jaybucks**, our exclusive currency!
 2. Check out [ROJI Inc.](https://rojikazoo.wordpress.com/) to see the products of the Republic of Jose and Ichick! Maybe you even want to join the company?
 3. When our school banned clubs, I had no choice but to make [Herder and the Box Club](https://herderandtheboxclub.wordpress.com/), which was a *cult* and therefore not forbidden. Take our initiation quiz and join the herd! We also have our **clubstitution** published so you can review it.
 4. I made a music awards show for my Tomodachi Life Miis. Listen and vote for your favorites at the [Tomodachi Music Awards Website](https://sites.google.com/view/tomodachimusicawards2020)
 5. Since it was an annual event, I did it the next year as well. See the 2021 music awards here: [2021 Tomodachi Music Awards](https://sites.google.com/view/tomodachimusicawards2021)
 6. This year, check for helpful academic resources at [The Headquarters](https://sites.google.com/view/hqtheheadquarters) - I will post notes, audiobooks, set up study groups, and more! Submit your own to help comtribute to the community!

## Fun Scratch Games I Made That You Should Play
1. [Strawdown](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/461502941/) is a rock-paper-scissors style fighting game with unique unlockable characters, an infinite challenge mode, and an arena mode! Still a WIP, most characters have been added and audio and animations are on the way
2. [Stick Guy](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/285720641/) is a little assistant you can play games with, dress up in cute hats, ask questions, play music, and so much more!
3. [SCP but it's scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/362602221/) is a early WIP, but it has working animations, an inventory system, combat, and more!

## My Favorite Image
I have had this image as my pfp for all school-related accounts ever since middle school. I just like it, it makes me happy.
