## Market Research

The first step in determining whether an idea or proposal is truly worth pursuing is to assess if there is a viable market for the product. In this case, the key question is: "Do gamers and anime enthusiasts (or 'weebs') actually want to spend money on anime girl statues made of soap?" Surprisingly, the answer is yes. Approximately $30 billion worth of soap products are sold annually in the United States alone, and, according to research, there is a niche market for anime-themed soap products. Otaku culture, which is associated with an obsession for anime and related subcultures, has even inspired creative solutions to address common social concerns, such as hygiene.
A notable example comes from Japan, where a product traps a sexy anime girl inside a bar of soap. As the user continues to use the soap, the character gradually becomes visible, encouraging regular use. This product addresses the cultural issue of “smelly otaku,” a concern so significant that companies like OxiClean have stepped in to donate detergent to card shops suffering from poor customer hygiene. Tapping into this passion for anime offers a way to create a product that not only caters to a large, dedicated market but also fulfills a functional need. According to surveys, up to 10% of the U.S. population identifies as deeply invested in anime, which translates to approximately 33.3 million potential customers. This broad audience offers an opportunity for our product to thrive within the market.

Once the market demand is established, the next focus is on the resources and production methods required to manufacture the product. To produce solid soap, essential ingredients such as fats or oils, an alkaline substance like lye for the saponification process, and water to dissolve the lye are necessary. Equipment like a precise scale to measure ingredients, a heat source to melt and blend the fats, and mixing tools such as a stick blender or whisk are needed to ensure the proper consistency. Soap molds, designed to shape the soap into anime characters, are also essential, along with a curing area for the soap to harden over several weeks. Additionally, fragrances, colorants, or exfoliants may be added to enhance the product's appeal.

However, the goal isn't just to produce basic soap; it's to develop a product that hooks users. For this, we plan to add "special ingredients," such as magic mushrooms and chemicals found in methamphetamines, to create a highly addictive product. This ensures that once a consumer tries our product, they will become lifelong customers. Sourcing these resources, however, requires careful planning. The best approach is to outsource from a location that produces the raw ingredients we need at low costs. Côte d'Ivoire, a gold coast nation known for its natural abundance, is an ideal candidate for providing fats, oils, and special mushrooms.
For the production process, establishing an industry in regions where labor costs are low and industrial setups are inexpensive is crucial. Countries like India or China provide the perfect environment for low-cost production, allowing us to produce the soap efficiently and at minimal cost. Beyond production, ensuring the product reaches consumers in an appealing manner is vital. The packaging will play a significant role in stimulating repeat purchases, using psychological tactics to encourage addiction. Loot Box-style packaging, combined with colorful and somewhat explicit anime images, will captivate the attention of both gamers and anime fans. By incorporating addictive substances and a design that taps into common consumer desires, we can create a product that not only grabs attention but also ensures long-term loyalty.

## Product Description
Each soap is scented and carved in the form of a 9’’ anime figure. Figures will be designed to look like cute anime characters - both girls and boys, of varying ages, aesthetics, and appearances (no children though, we won’t cross that line). Soaps will come in fun colors made to suit the character. Characters will vary in poses and costumes, and we can release different soaps of the same character in different outfits or positions. Obviously we will lean into the sex appeal of anime, making a good portion of the characters fanservice-y in some way, but there will still be some that are modestly dressed. Fundamentally, the principle of figure design is to create memorable but simple designs that you could easily see appearing on a body pillow. Inside of each soap will be a smaller, non-soap figure made out of a fragile glass material. This way, the only way to access the true figure is to use the soap (preventing you from breaking it with a hammer or some other method of destruction). Our customers using the soap is very important to us, both as a part of our overall mission (to make gamers less stinky) and our money-making methods (as will be demonstrated later).
 
 Figures are released in Collections, with each collection containing their own unique sets. Figures in a set will come in varying levels of rarity, being ‘common’, ‘rare’, and ‘epic’ - depending on the rarity, it will require more purchases to obtain the desired figure. This is not because those figures are rarer - it is because of our unique loot box mechanic; on the surface it will appear like the figure you get is purely luck-based, but really it’s based on the amount of money you spend on the soaps. Each consumer who signs up for an account on our store (all sales will be through our website for this reason) will be assigned a Buy Factor - this is the threshold they will need to pass before they can buy rare or epic figures (for instance, let’s say your Buy Factor is 1300 - you will need to spend $1300 before you can get any rare or epic figures.) This number is different for each consumer so as to avoid anyone noticing the system is rigged. They will, however, always be over 100. Buy Factors are rerolled whenever a threshold is reached - this means that you can only get one rare figure before you need to spend another obscene amount of money. Generally, each soap will sell for 20-50 dollars, depending on the collection. 
	
 As for why anyone would be willing to spend thousands on soap, this is down to our secret ingredient - nicotine. On repeated contact with the skin, this will create a psychoactive and incredibly addictive response to the soaps (much like that of a nicotine patch), trapping people in a repeated cycle of needing to buy them. Since nicotine is a perfectly legal substance, we can 100% get away with doing this. Not to mention the fact that we’re targeting gamers and weebs and these are anime girl figures; people already spend an excessive amount of money on those things (for reference, the average cost for an anime figure is around $100, at least for the good ones. Even our high-end $50 price point is comparatively cheap). We could even do crossover events with popular anime or games to further boost the desire to buy - imagine Genshin Impact soaps, Vocaloid soaps, Jojo’s soaps, etc, etc. For those who want to buy our soaps but are really strapped for cash, we will also have liquid soaps (still infused with nicotine) that are much cheaper. Instead of being shaped like anime characters, they will have images of them plastered on the bottle - these soaps will run for around $10, making them much more affordable. 
 Our proposal didn't actually have any images in it, so I added this for this assignment (It's an AI mockup of what our soaps might look like from our original brainstorming) ![AI Soap Mockup](/assets/md-images/SOAP.png)

## Problems and Counterarguments
Some argue that a “hypothetical methamphetamine substitute constituted from a combination of THC and psychedelics” is bound to become illegal soon after we invent and trademark it, as well as be highly immoral and unethical. And to that I ask you, did that stop Jesus when the Romans told him to stop practicing his truth? Either way, this is still legal as of the start, to the point where others have done similar modifications to their products. Many pharmaceuticals and chemicals are invented and/or created every year to the point where there are entire communities based around experimenting with these new and unregulated chemicals and their combinations. And sugar is a major part of many industries today, which is a drug like caffeine is, and that’s pretty much the same thing as what we are planning to do. 
Others argue that the customers we’re targeting who are stereotyped to not smell good won’t use the soap we make. But you see, we don’t need them to use them, we need them to buy them. We are selling soap to a group of people who don’t usually use it super often, supply and demand, and they demand 2D characters which we will use to market soap. And if they DO use the soap (since they might as well) then it’s a win win win! And they also will buy more afterwards.
Our final common straw man argument (since nobody besides us knows about this proposal yet and can’t make any arguments themselves)  we made up is that many people are too poor to buy the soap shaped into figurines, and to that we have a solution; liquid soap! To elaborate, we’ll make soap for bottles, but put images of the characters on the bottles. This solution is cheap, easy to do, and profitable. Another fun option we have is putting non-soap figurines in the bricks of soap that the customer will have to use in order to get their prize!
